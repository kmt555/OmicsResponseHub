# OmicsResponseHub

Welcome to OmicsResponseHub! This repository is dedicated to curating and organizing links to datasets for research into drug responses at both the bulk RNA and single-cell RNA levels. This collection focuses on datasets where gene expression profiles are matched with drug response information, providing invaluable resources for studying the molecular underpinnings of drug resistance and efficacy.

## Features:
- Bulk RNA-seq Data with Drug Response: Links to datasets where bulk RNA-sequencing data is coupled with drug response profiles, enabling comprehensive analysis of transcriptional changes associated with treatment.

- Single-Cell RNA-seq Data with Drug Response: Resources for single-cell RNA-sequencing data paired with drug response information, facilitating the exploration of cellular heterogeneity and its impact on treatment outcomes.

- Multi-Omic Datasets: Access to integrated multi-omic datasets that combine genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, offering a holistic view of drug response mechanisms.

## Purpose:

OmicsResponseHub aims to support researchers in identifying and leveraging relevant data for studying gene regulatory networks, drug resistance mechanisms, and treatment responses. By providing a centralized hub for these datasets, we hope to advance the field of precision medicine and foster collaborations across various cancer research domains.
